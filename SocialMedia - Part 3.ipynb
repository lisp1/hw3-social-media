    "Natural Language Processing involves a series of operations on an input text, each building off of the previous step to add additional insight and undertanding.  Thus, many NLP packages run as pipeline processors providing modular components at each stage of the process. Separating key steps into discrete packages provides needed modularity, as developers can modify and customize individual components as needed. spaCy, like other NLP tools including [GATE](https://gate.ac.uk/) and [cTAKES](https://ctaes.apache.org)  operate on such a model. Although the specific components of each pipeline vary from system to system (and from tasks to task, the key tasks are roughly similar:\n",

    "2. *Part of speech tagging*: Classifying terms as nouns, verbs, adjective, adverbs, ec.\n",
    "3. *Dependency Parsing* or *Chunking*: Defining relationships between tokens (subject and object of sentence) and grouping into noun and veb phrases.\n",
    "4. *Named Entity Recognition*: Mapping words or phrases to standard vocabularies or other common, known values. This step is often key for linking free text to accepted terms for diseases, symptoms, and/or anatomic locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these steps might be accomplished through rules, machine learning models, or some combination of approaches. After these initial steps are complete, results might be used to identify relationships between items in the text, build classifiers, or otherwise conduct further analysis. We'll get into these topics later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [spaCy documentation](https://spaCy.io/usage/spaCy-101) and [cTAKES default pipeline description](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CTAKES/Default+Clinical+Pipeline) provide two examples of how these components might be arranged in practice.

    "3.1.1 Using the `getRandomTweetText`, and `printTokDetails` routines above, aong with the spaCy `parser` command, examine several tweets to decide which tokens should be included or not.  List criteria for keeeping/removing tokens. Remember to use `spacy.explain()` for any unfamiliar POS or tag entries. Note that your  criteria will not be perfect, and will likely need refinining. Examine enough tweets to feel confident in your criteria. Because we are parsing tweets, please don't forget hashtags and user mentions.\n",

    "3.1.2 Write a routine  `includeToken` that will return a token to be inclued if it matches the criteria that you identified in 3.11, and false otherwise.  Assume for now that we are only interested in nouns and verbs, as they might be a good starting point to find information about vaping or smoking. For any tokens that are included,`includeToken` should return the lemmatized-version of the token, converted to all lower-case and stripped of any whitespace, using `strip()`. Zero-length tokens should not be included.\n",

    "3.1.3 Write a routine `filterTweetTokens` that will filter the parsed tokens from a single tweet, returning a list of the tokens to be included, based on your criteria from `includeToken`. To standardize matters, `filterTweetTokens` should also return the lemmatized-version of the token, converted to all lower-case.\n",

On the other hand, Spacy is also lack of the ability for analyzing the relationship cross different sentence. Some deep learning based NLP pre-trained models, such as the BERT model of google that is based on Tensorflow, perform a lot better in various complex dependency analysis task, no matter cross different sentences or inside one sentence. As one thing interesting to pursue further for the future version of this exercise/module, you may try to combine new powerful models like BERT to the present version, encouraging future students to give a try on the new models, and compare results of these models and the original Spacy one."
